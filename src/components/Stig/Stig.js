                    <li>Some say that he lives in a tree, and that his sweat can be used to clean precious metals.</li>
                    <li>Some say that his voice can only be heard by cats, and that he has two sets of knees.</li>
                    <li>Some say his skin has the texture of a dolphinâ€™s, and that wherever you are in the world, if you turn your radio to 88.4 you can actually hear his thoughts. </li>
